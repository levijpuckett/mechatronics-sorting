Interrupt-driven system which sorts 48 pieces of 4 different materials (aluminum, steel, black and white plastic) in 31 seconds. The apparatus consists of a conveyor belt driven by a DC motor, sensors along the conveyor belt to identify the peices, and a tray divided into quadrants driven by a DC stepper motor. Interrupts are generated by optical sensors, and parts are enqueued and dequeued as they are placed on the belt, and sorted into the tray.

The system was controlled using an Atmel 8-bit microcontroller (AT90USB1287).
